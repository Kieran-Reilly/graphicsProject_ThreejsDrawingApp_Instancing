# Canvas Drawing Project Using Three.js

Project to explore a drawing application that makes use of a particle system and mouse trail based on Franks laboratory's [HTML5 Canvas CRASH COURSE for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y&ab_channel=Frankslaboratory), but using Three.js. Copy of the previous graphicsProject_ThreejsDrawingApp but using instancing to generate the particles for better performance
